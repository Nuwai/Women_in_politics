# Women's Involvement in Politics and Violence Against Women in Politics

## Project Overview
This project analyzes women's participation in politics and the prevalence of violence or attacks targeting women in political roles. By studying trends, patterns, and underlying factors, the project aims to:

- Provide insights into the challenges faced by women in politics
- Highlight areas requiring intervention
- Support data-driven advocacy for gender equity and the safety of women in politics
Note: This project is part of **ongoing research conducted by Myo Thida** on public violence targeting women in politics.

## Objective
- Assess the level of women's participation and representation in politics.
- Investigate trends and patterns of violence or attacks targeting women in political roles.
- Explore the underlying factors contributing to gender-based violence in politics.
- Provide actionable recommendations to support gender equity and the safety of women in politics.

### Data Points
Data will be collected through secondary sourcess:
- **Demographics**: Age, region, political affiliation, and roles held by women in politics.
- **Violence Reports**: Types, frequency, and severity of violence (physical, verbal, or cyber) targeting women in politics.

### Data Characteristics

- Multi-country coverage, including diverse political systems
- Includes both quantitative data (MP counts, violence counts) and qualitative insights (reports, case studies)
- Processed and analyzed for patterns across regions, roles, and political contexts
  
### Methodology
- **Parliamentary Data**: Public datasets on Members of Parliament (MPs) from different countries, including gender representation and political roles. (https://data.ipu.org/women-ranking/)
- **PVTW dataset**: Public datasets on violence against women in politics.(https://acleddata.com/political-violence-targeting-women/)
- **Descriptive Analysis**:  Use charts and graphs to identify trends, patterns, and differences across regions or demographics.
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
  - Collect parliamentary and PVTW datasets
  - Standardize formats and clean data for analysis
  - Merge datasets for cross-country comparison
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Use charts, graphs, and descriptive statistics to identify trends
  - Compare women’s representation with frequency of PVTW incidents
- **Statistical Analysis**
  - Hypothesis testing and correlation analysis
  - Evaluate relationships between women’s political participation and PVTW
- **Reporting & Visualization**
  - Generate presentations, reports, and dashboards for policymakers, advocacy groups, and researchers

### Expected Outcomes
- **Insights into Women's Political Involvement**: A clear understanding of the current state of women's participation in politics.
- **Analysis of Violence Trends:**  Identification of the types and patterns of violence against women in politics.
- **Data-driven suggestions** for policymakers, advocacy groups, and international organizations to enhance gender equity and safeguard women in politics..
